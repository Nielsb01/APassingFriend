The camera priority settings are the following:

The highest priority virtual camera becomes active.

Unavailable camera's are priority 0.
Available camera's that shouldn't be active are priority 1.
Default camera has priority 10.
Special situation camera has priority 100. (these include side view and tail view for tunnels)

If you want to take over the screen in any situation, you should make your virtual camera priority 101 or higher.
