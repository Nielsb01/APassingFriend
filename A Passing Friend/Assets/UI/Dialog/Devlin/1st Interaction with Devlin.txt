*1 Well…uh… hello. You must be one of the new arrivals.
*2 This is all very new to me. uhm… welcome to the (tailor shop). How can I help you today…?
*3 Oh, you are looking to collect your memories.
*3 Sorry, I am a bit distracted, because I am looking for the red ball of wool. 
*4 I can’t start my work if I don’t find it.
*5 Have you seen it by any chance?
*6 My mother used to run this shop. She passed away and I had to take over the business.
*7 Only the stitches never seem to work out the way I want. I don't think I'm cut out for this.
*8 But if you can find the ball of wool I might be able to help you with your memory.
