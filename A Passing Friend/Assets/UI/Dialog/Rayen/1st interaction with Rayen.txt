*2 FLAMINGOS!!! 
*3 It went wrong again! 
*4 Oh uh hello, sorry about that. 
*5 ’ve been trying to make this one potion for a few days, but it just explodes every time.
*6 Sorry my name is Rayen, I am the potion witch of the Shimmer Wood village.
*7 Let me just check one more thing in my recipe book.
*8 Oh wait! I added too little catnip. 
*9 Of course I used the last bit on a potion a while back, so I’m all out. 
*10 You don’t have any catnip with you by any chance? 
*11 Would you mind finding it for me?
