# 1st interaction with Rayen$ [Camera: 0] [Checkpoint: 6]
*1 Almost there, just one more ingredient and I am….
*2 FLAMINGOS!!! 
*3 It went wrong again! 
*4 Oh uh hello, sorry about that. I’ve been trying to make this one potion for a few days, but it just explodes every time.
*5 Sorry my name is Rayen, I am the potion witch of the Shimmer Wood village.
*6 Let me just check one more thing in my recipe book.
*7 Oh wait! I added too little catnip. Of course I used the last bit on a potion a while back, so I’m all out. 
*8 You don’t have any catnip with you by any chance? 
*9 Would you mind finding it for me?
