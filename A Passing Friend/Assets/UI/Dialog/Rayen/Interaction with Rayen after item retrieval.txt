# Interaction with Rayen after item retrieval$ [Camera: 0] [Audio: 1] [Checkpoint: 8]
*1 Okay I seem to have everything except for the…, oh hi you are back already!”
*2 Do you have the catnip I needed?
*3  You do? That is amazing! Thank you so much. Now I can hopefully finish that potion. 
*4 How can I help you further today? You need help finding memories and lost items. 
*5 I already thought so when you first walked in.
*6 So you have collected 2 memories already, impressive! 
*7 Have you checked out the (shrine tree) already? 
*8 Whenever you find your memories and items they will slowly start to appear in the tree.
*9 You haven't yet? 
*10 If you stand in front of the little altar in front of the tree,
*11 you are able to see all the objects and memories you collected throughout your adventures.
*12 Anyway, thank you for helping out and good luck finding the other items and memories you are looking for.
